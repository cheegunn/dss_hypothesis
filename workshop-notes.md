**Workshop Outline**

Introductions - Why are we here? What are our experiences with annotation, web or otherwise?   

Discuss uses of digital annotation - open peer review, open scholarly editions, classroom uses  

Walk through processes of signing up, annotating and highlighting text  

Walk through searching and exporting annotations  

Question that came up - how does hypothes.is work on pages that are not static? I.e., New York Times home page, social media timelines? It looks like the hypothes.is team is experimenting with this now.
